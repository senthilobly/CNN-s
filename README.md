# Understanding CNN-s on Deep Learning network
**1. What is Image Data?**
- Digital Images are just numbers representing pixel intensities.
- Grayscale Image → each pixel is a number between 0 (black) and 255 (white).
- RGB Image → each pixel has 3 numbers (Red, Green, Blue channels).

Example:

Grayscale image of 28x28 → shape = (28, 28)

RGB image of 64x64 → shape = (64, 64, 3)
